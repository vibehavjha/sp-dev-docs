## New features and capabilities

### New Data Visualization Card options for Viva Connections

As part of the SPFx v1.19 release, we provided new line chart card layout option and with SPFx v1.20, we're introducing three new data visualization options: bar chart, pie chart and donut chart.

### HTML Quick View support for Viva Connections cards

With the SPFx v1.20 version, we're introducing new option to use HTML to render the Viva Connection Adaptive Card Extension Quick Views. This enables more advanced user experiences. You can even use whatever suitable JavaScript web framework you prefer (that is: React etc.) in your Quick View experiences.

You can start using this option by updating your Quick View implementation to be inherited from xxx class, which will be automatically detected by the underlying platform.

Out-of-the-box OneDrive (files) card is using this rendering option as a reference point.

This enables more complex user interfaces for the Viva Connections vs the previously supported adaptive card option. Adaptive Cards will keep on being supported also as an option. You can use whatever JavaScript frameworks you'd like in the actual implementation, which provides more flexibility for developers.

### Fix for [object|object] issue

As part of the transitioning to WebPack 5 with the SPFx 1.19, exception details where impacted as called out with in issue [#9834](https://github.com/SharePoint/sp-dev-docs/issues/9834).

This issue has been fixed and is by default fixed for any new project created with the SPFx Yeoman generator 1.20. For the previously created project, you can fix this issue with following updates:

- SPFx tools packages version is 1.20.2

- Optional: fix new lint errors such as *"@typescript-eslint/no-unsafe-function-type rule is not found"* by modifying .eslintrc.js
- Optional: fix other lint rules related to the code and not ESLint configuration

## Deprecations

No new updates.

## Fixed Issues

- [#9834](https://github.com/SharePoint/sp-dev-docs/issues/9834) - SPFx 1.19.0 - Error during bundle says [object Object] instead of displaying a clear message.
